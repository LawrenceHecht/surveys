They have enabled things we could not otherwise do. If it relied on this alone, I would score this much more highly. But, the CNCF is more than the staff and services provided. There are 4 things that make me vote this lower and, much of the time, not recommend the CNCF. 1. There is a lack of professionalism among a number in the community. This portrays the community and the projects poorly. Being separate from the CNCF lets the projects have more control over the professionalism perception. 2. At KubeCon/CloudNativeCon the Helm project hasn't been represented well. For example, the project has consistently been given a room for their maintainer sessions that reaches capacity and turns people away. At some of the conferences there are few sessions relating to Helm even though we know many are submitted. From metrics we know Helm is widely used by end-users. I have the impression that those picking sessions and setting rooms don't reflect that. I have this impression even though I've been on the organizing end of conferences and know how difficult it is to do some of this. 3. There are many distractions in the CNCF that take away time from the projects themselves and are often not enablers. Sometimes there are good distractions (e.g., the TAG Security white paper). Other times (more often than not) they are not useful distractions such as dealing with unclear processes or community politics. 4.
