,,"CloudEvents, Serverless WG","Yes, and my needs were generally met",,10,,10,,6,10,,10,,10,,10,,10,,10,9,I worry about the CNCF becoming an org where one of its goals is self preservation. Meaning it becomes a bureaucracy that exists more to promote itself rather than simply as a home for CN tech to collaborate . For example recently someone high up made a comment to me about how a certain org structure is there as mechanism for career path promotion. That bothered me.,10,,7,,None,Perhaps be more proactive on meetups to help promote our tech,None,Question 7 should be optional or allow a n/an answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
